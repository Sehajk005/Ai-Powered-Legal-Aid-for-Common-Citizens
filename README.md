# AI-Powered Legal Aid for Common Citizens

## Overview

**AI-Powered Legal Aid for Common Citizens** is a Streamlit-based application that leverages advanced AI and natural language processing to help everyday users understand complex legal documents. The app extracts key information, translates legal jargon into plain English, and provides intelligent clause-by-clause analysis with risk assessments. It also features an integrated chatbot for document-specific Q&A and a feedback mechanism to support research in Responsible AI and LLM Alignment.

## Features

- **PDF Document Upload**: Upload legal documents in PDF format for analysis
- **Entity Extraction**: Automatically identifies names, dates, addresses, organizations, and other key entities
- **Clause Analysis**: Splits documents into distinct clauses with summaries and risk assessments
- **Interactive Q&A Chat**: Ask specific questions about your document and receive AI-powered answers
- **Feedback Interface**: Rate responses and provide comments to help improve the AI
- **Privacy-Focused**: Secure Google Sheets integration for anonymized feedback collection

## Research Purpose

This project serves a dual purpose:

1. **Democratizing Legal Knowledge**: Making legal documents accessible to common citizens without legal expertise
2. **Advancing Responsible AI Research**: Collecting feedback data to improve:
   - **Responsible AI**: Transparency, fairness, safety, and explainability in legal AI systems
   - **LLM Alignment**: Ensuring large language models provide reliable, unbiased, and safe legal information
