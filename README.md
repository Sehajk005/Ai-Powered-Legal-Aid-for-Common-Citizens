# AI-Powered Legal Aid for Common Citizens

## 📋 Overview

**AI-Powered Legal Aid for Common Citizens** is a Streamlit-based application that leverages advanced AI and natural language processing to help everyday users understand complex legal documents. The app extracts key information, translates legal jargon into plain English, and provides intelligent clause-by-clause analysis with risk assessments. It also features an integrated chatbot for document-specific Q&A and a feedback mechanism to support research in Responsible AI and LLM Alignment.
